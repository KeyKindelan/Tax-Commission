			<p><span class="firstCap">T</span>he New York City Tax Commission is reducing Manhattan land-owners' property taxes more than three-times more often than those in the Bronx or Staten Island, and almost twice as often as those in Brooklyn or Queens.   
			</p>
			<p>An investigation into the commissions annual report revealed an uneven spread of reductions across the five boroughs. Manhattan received the highest proportion of tax reductions at 21 percent of total property taxes paid, while Staten Island and the Bronx both received only about six percent. 
			</p>
			<p>This comes as the mayor-appointed commission chugs along with two vacancies and a seat nine-years past its expiration. New York City rules determine that "at least one resident of each borough" is included in the body, with staggered six-year appointments. Manhattan is well-manned with its commissioner's seat expiring in January of 2030. The Bronx and Queens are both vacant, and Brooklyn's seat is noted as expiring in January of 2016. 			
			</p>
			<p>The vacancy in the Bronx is particularly noteworthy in light of the few reductions the borough's property owners received in the 2024 Annual Report. The application for a reduction is submitted to the commission and reviewed under certain guidelines. 
			</p>

			<p>The Tiffany and Company building on 5th Avenue in Manhattan got $42.5 million shaved off of its assessed value on the report, about $4.6 million in actual taxes. 
			</p>
			<p>More than twice that amount was chopped off the assessed value of 767 Fifth Avenue, a building formerly owned by Donald J. Trump and currently home to the flagship Apple store near Central Park. The building's owners got a monumental $87.8 million dollars removed from their assessed value, translating to almost $9.5 million dollars in taxes cut from the city's coffers. 
			</p>	
			<p>
			Dollar amounts obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests reveal the building was 91.10 percent rented, and the owners' profitted $148 million dollars from the building on the application for a reduced value. Still, the commission approved the reduction.

			<p>Comments from the commission or the attorney for 767 Fifth Avenue were not obtained.</p>
